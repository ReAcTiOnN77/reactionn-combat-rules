# ReAcTiOnN's Combat Rules

A lightweight **D&D 5e Foundry VTT module** that enhances tactical combat with automated optional rules such as **flanking**, **surrounded bonuses**, **high-ground modifiers**, and **condition-based advantage/disadvantage**.  
All features are fully toggleable through world settings so GMs can fine-tune combat to their table’s preferences.

## Features

### **Flanking**
Automatically grants a **+2 bonus to hit** when a melee attacker and an ally are positioned on opposite cardinal sides of a target.

#### **Flanking Behaviour Options**
Choose how flanking should work at your table:
- **Advantage**
- **+1 to hit**
- **+2 to hit** *(default)*
- **+3 to hit**
- **+4 to hit**
- **+5 to hit**

Optional rule:  
- **Flanking Requires Active Ally** — The ally must not be prone, incapacitated, stunned, petrified, paralyzed, unconscious or dead.

---

### **Surrounded**
When all four cardinal spaces around a target are blocked by enemies or walls, attackers gain **advantage** on melee attacks.

---

### **High Ground**
Ranged weapon and spell attacks gain a **+2 bonus** when the attacker is at least **10 feet above** the target’s elevation.

Automatically applies advantage or disadvantage based on common status conditions, including:
